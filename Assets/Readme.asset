  sections:
  - heading: Preparation
    text: 'First of all, you need to open GunsBox VR / Map Exporter in main menu. '
    linkText: 
    url: 
  - heading: 1) Map Settings
    text: Name the map. If you have another map with the same name, it will be rewritten.
    linkText: 
    url: 
  - heading: 2) Required objects
    text: Inventory and starting point on loading the map. 'Add Inventory' creates
      an inventory or replaces the prevoius inventory - if there is one - in the
      scene. 'Add spawn point'creates a starting point or replaces the prevoius point.
      Only one inventory and only one starting point can be placed on the map.

  - heading: 4) Screenshots
    text: Choose the view (try to avoid 'Required Objects') and press 'Create screenshot
      for game' to make an image for displaying it in the game. All the images are
      captured from the view in the 'Scene' tab and saved into 'Screenshots' folder
      (it will be highlighted in the 'Project' tab) You can choose any image you
      like (or upload your own one in the folder) by 'Select screenshot for game'.
      You can't build the map without image!
